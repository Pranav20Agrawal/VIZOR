There are a few things we all can do, to make our lives easier on campus.

Please keep left while walking in the corridors and climbing the stairs.

DO not crowd in corridors and walkways. Give way to the people who are passing by.

Wait till people get out, before you get in to an elevator.

Do not throw papers and waste around. Use waste bins.

Be respectful, kind and helpful to Visitors, Teachers and Students.

Maintain silence in libraries, classrooms, and study areas.

Keep mobiles on silent mode in class. Avoid loud conversations and music indoors.

Be punctual. Respect everyone's time.

Dress appropriately and neatly.

10. Keep your campus pristine: avoid scribbling on walls, desks and damaging facilities.

Keep the outdoors clean. Avoid plucking flowers and damaging plants.

11. Do not jump queues.

12. Use water and electricity wisely: turn off lights and fans when not needed.

13. Report any suspicious or unsafe activity to the authorities promptly.
